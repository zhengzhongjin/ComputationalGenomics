Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/local/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	12	accuracy
	1	target
	13

rule accuracy:
    input: test/shingles_20.acc.params
    output: test/shingles_20.acc
    jobid: 12
    wildcards: param=shingles_20

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
