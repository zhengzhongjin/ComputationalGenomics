Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/local/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:

    output: test/kbanded_12_10.result
    jobid: 175
    wildcards: param=kbanded_12_10

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
