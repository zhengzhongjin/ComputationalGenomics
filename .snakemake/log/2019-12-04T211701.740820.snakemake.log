Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/local/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	12	accuracy
	1	target
	13

    wildcards: param=shingles_11

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
